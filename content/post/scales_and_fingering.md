+++

The first two lessons of the year have been mostly about basic scales and how
to finger them. So far we've been sticking with quite basic scales, like C
major or scales that contain one flat note, like D minor or F major. Running
these scales up and down the keyboard while paying attention to proper
fingering (thumb on F and C, never on flat/sharp notes etc).

We've also talked about scale degrees, basic chord progressions and cadences
like IV-V-I. One exercise I got home was to go play this cadence in various
keys and try to find the inversions of the chords that make it easiest to play.

I also got a song (a tango!) that has an easy intro. I learned how to play that
intro, paying special attention to fingering. It was slow at first, but that
was mostly due to my poor sheet music reading. The actual playing part was
pretty easy once I nailed down the notes I was supposed to play.

It seems there's a lot of work to do with just the groundwork. Getting more
fluent with sheet music, nailing down various scales and playing them quickly
on the keyboard - that sort of stuff.
