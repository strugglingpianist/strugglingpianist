This week's lesson was a bit different. We spent half of it ordering a piano
for me. (See [the previous post]({{< relref "post/i_need_a_piano.md" >}}) for
background.) We got the Kawai, and it should arrive any day. Free shipping too!
I'm pretty stoked.

As we spent most of the lesson shopping for gear, the musical part was a bit
brief. We went over some chord inversions again. I was also introduced to
[cadences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_(music\)) and how in certain
type of music, a chord progression may repeat without a cadence for an extened
period of time. [Oye Como Va](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NsJ84YV1oA) was
mentioned as an example.

We didn't get to jam Only Heart this time, as I explained my poor circumstances
for practicing my homework.

The most important takeaway for me, in addition to having ordered the piano,
was that I seriously need to step up my music theory game. I asked the teacher
for some tips and resources for learning notes and chords, learning to read
sheet music and the very basics of knowing your way around the keyboard. I got
a few tips, but more on those in another post.
