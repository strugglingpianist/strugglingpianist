Last week, I lamented my poor grasp of music theory. It's clear that it is
quickly becoming the number one bottleneck hindering my learning and
practicing. I asked my teacher for some tips on books and other resources that
could help me jump-start my theoretical basis.

He mentioned a nice book called Tohtori Toonika (English: "Doctor
[Tonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_(music\))").  Unfortunately it's in
Finnish, so this post may be less interesting to all non-Finnish readers.
Anyway, it appears to be a pretty solid introductory book on theory. The
authors are or have been teaching this stuff in [the largest Pop & Jazz
institute in Finland](http://www.popjazz.fi/), so they should know what they're
talking about.

The contents are split into three sections: rhythm, melody and harmony. Each
section starts off with the very basics and progresses towards more advanced
topics. The idea is that once you get a hold of the basics of rhythm, you
should start reading about the basics of melody. Once you got that govered, you
can proceed to learn about harmony.  After a while, you study each section
simultaneously towards more advanced concepts.

The rhythm section starts with the concept of beat, then quarter notes and
eight notes, rests and so forth. On the other end of the spectrum, jazz waltz,
swing and articulation are discussed.  Similarly, the melody section starts
with the very basics by defining the staff, clefs, the C major scale and so
forth, all the way to different modes and scales. The final section begins by
introducing basic intervals and proceeds to go over various types of chord
types, voicings and so forth.

The emphasis of the first two sections is clearly to have the reader start
reading and transcribing sheet music as early as possible, starting from a very
basic level. I imagine this will be invaluable in the process of learning
piano.
