The most interesting thing about today's lesson was the gentle introduction to
[modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music\)), or more specifically, the
[Dorian Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_mode#Modern_Dorian_mode). I
was already somewhat familiar with modes, or at least knew what they were, but
I didn't really know which one is which and how they're used.

So what's Dorian Mode? There are basically a couple of different ways to think
about it. First, you can think of it as the same as a natural minor scale, but
with the 6th note sharp (raised a half step). Another way to think about it is
that it includes the same notes as the major scale of the one full step below
the tonic. So, to play the Dorian Mode in D, the notes included are those of
the C major scale, but of course starting from D.  Both approaches obviously
result in the same intervals (W-H-W-W-W-H-W). This all may apprear slightly
confusing in writing perhaps, but it's really simple once you play and hear it.
It's instantly recognizeable.

As an exercise, perhaps unsurprisingly, I'm to practice this by improvising on
the G major scale over the Am7 chord, which actually is, you guessed it, the
Dorian Mode in A. And of course transpose this to other keys as well.
