Today's lesson was pretty much more of the same as before. We played some
scales. I learned I should pay more attention to keeping consistent timing when
practicing scales. Now it seems I'm a bit sloppy, as I'm just concentrating on
nailing the right notes.

On the other hand, when we did some rhythm excercises, I got compliments.
Apparently my timing on rhythm excercises is very good. I guess all those years
playing drums may have an impact on that. But it was nice to hear.

I got some more cadences and chord progressions to practice at home. The
teacher wrote down a progression of various common chords which I am to
practice. I will also continue with the rudiments of sheet music, rhythm and
harmony.
