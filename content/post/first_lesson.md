Today I had my first lesson. Altough I was very excited to actually start
learning, when I sat down in front of the piano I realized I was very tense and
anxious. The flashbacks came from childhood when trying to learn the easiest of
guitar licks while my teacher is impatiently waiting for me to get it right.

Luckily the tension quickly subsided, as my current piano teacher is nothing
like the impatient guitar instructor from my childhood. In a way it was
actually quite refreshing and liberating to realize I know nothing and cannot
do anything, and that's OK. When you have no expectations, you can only
surprise yourself positively.

Anyway, we started out by listening to [Only Heart by John
Mayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9YR_D83iis) and discussing it briefly.
Turns out, this song is an example of one that may appear as yet another simple
pop piece, but actually has many elements that make it quite interesting both
rhythmically as well as harmonically.

Then I sat down in front of the piano and started the painful process of
finding some chords on the keys. We discussed chord inversions and how they
help make "fingering", for a lack of a better word, a lot easier and add
variety to the sound making it more interesting.

The 45 minutes were up quite quickly, and as the lesson was supposed to last 30
minutes, it was time to wrap up. My homework assignment was to learn the part A
of the song so that my right hand plays the chords as whole notes while my
left hand takes care of the bass line.

I can't wait to get practicing. The only problem is, I don't have an
instrument.  I have a feeling this needs to be addressed quickly.
