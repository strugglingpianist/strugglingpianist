Not having a piano makes practicing a bit difficult. I quickly realized this
once I started working my way through my first real home assignment.

To be fair, I do have a small MIDI keyboard, with a whopping range of two and a
half octaves. The lower half of the keys do not work at all. Not to mention the
actual keyboard action is pretty much as far from a real piano as you can get.
It really will not do.

So it was clear I should probably make an investment into a proper instrument.
I live in an apartment building and my neighbors are not the most tolerant of
people, which pretty much rules out a real acoustic piano. I want 88 hammer
action keys so that my fingers get used to the feel of a real instrument. 

A digital piano will be my weapon of choice. I'll be mostly using headphones,
so while a built-in speaker doesn't hurt, it's not really a requirement, which
means I'll be considering stage pianos. An USB to host would be nice to have,
as I intend to use it as a master keyboard for recording and playing software
instruments.  I narrowed my search by ruling out the cheapest and the most
expensive models.

Amongst the chosen alternatives were Roland FP-80 (and FP-50), Kawai ES-8 and
Yamaha CP40. Ideally, you should go and test the instrument to find one that
you like playing. But to be honest, I really don't know if a piano feels
"better" or "worse" or just different, at this point. So I figured it's best to
choose one that fits the specs and is approved by the teacher. I sent him the
list to get his opinion.

He pretty much approved all the options. But turns out, he gets a great deal on
the Kawai! He'd recently bought a grand piano from a dealer and thus was on
very good terms with them. It also turned out that the Kawai is available in
white, which will make it easier to get this approved with the spouse...

So we settled on the Kawai, and will be ordering it when we meet the next time.
I was of course anxious to buy the thing ASAP, but it needs to be done with the
teacher in order to make use of the bargain deal he gets.

In the meantime, I need to make the most of the MIDI keyboard I have. To be
specific, I have to practice the left and right hands separately, as I have
only an octave's worth of working keys on the keyboard... It's so ridiculous
it's actually funny.
