I met with the teacher yesterday. We discussed the basics of starting the
lessons. He asked me a bunch of questions about what I do and don't know, to
give him an idea of how he should start teaching me. Things like what kind of
history I have with music in the first place, if I read sheet music, how
familiar I am with chords and so forth.

He also gave me some high-level recommendations for buying an instrument. As it
happens, I do not have a piano, which is probably bad for learning to play it.
Anyway, more on that later.

The whole ordeal was a bit chaotic, as his babysitter had stood him up and he'd
had to bring his toddler with him, but I think we managed to work out the
details of how we should start the lessons. Finally, we booked the first
lesson for next week!

After the meeting, I got my first piece of homework for the first actual lesson
in the email. Basically, a handful of rhythms for me to tap onto the desk or
whatever. I also got a song that I should listen to, and we're going to start
looking at in the first lesson. Here we go!
