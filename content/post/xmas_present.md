This year, xmas was especially exciting, as I had a special gift planned for
myself. The Kawai did indeed arrive a couple of days before xmas. After
unboxing it and finding a place for it in the apartment (not easy by the way),
I finally got to plug it in and hit that middle-C. 

The piano looks pretty, sounds great and the build is solid, so what's not to
love? As it's not a low-end instrument by any means, I'm sure it'll be great
even after I've learned how to play some actual music on it.
