For a long while, I've wanted to learn to play the piano. As it stands, I know
absolutely nothing about it. I'm a self-learned guitarist and bassist, and I
dabble with drums as well. I'm not very good, but I played in a couple of
hobbyist bands for some years. I know basically nothing about music theory, and
I don't read sheet music.

After moving into a different city and leaving my bands behind, I've found
myself mulling over the prospect of learning piano. Last week, I finally
decided to do something about it, and booked a meeting with an instructor.

I decided to start this blog to document my progression from a complete
neophyte into, well, I don't know what exactly. I'm not so young anymore, and
not particularly talented, so I'm not sure how good a pianist I can become in
the first place. But I suppose we'll find out.

All I know is, there's no turning back now.
